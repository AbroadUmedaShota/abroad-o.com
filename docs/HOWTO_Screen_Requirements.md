# HOWTO: Screen Requirements Definition Documents

## 1. Introduction
This document provides an overview and guide to the generated "Screen Requirements Definition Documents" for each HTML page within this project. These documents aim to offer a clear and concise understanding of each web page's structure, purpose, functionality, and external dependencies.

## 2. Document Location
All generated Screen Requirements Definition Documents are located in the `docs/screen_requirements/` directory.

## 3. Content Structure of Each Document
Each Markdown document (`.md` file) in the `docs/screen_requirements/` directory follows a consistent structure, detailing the following aspects of a web page:

*   **Page Title:** The title displayed in the browser tab or window.
*   **URL:** The relative path to the HTML file.
*   **Purpose:** A brief description of the page's main goal or function.
*   **Key Elements/Sections:** A breakdown of the major structural components and content areas on the page (e.g., header, navigation, main content sections, forms, footer).
*   **Functionality:** A description of any interactive elements, dynamic behaviors, form submissions, or other user interactions.
*   **Dependencies:** A list of external CSS, JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and other resources that the page relies on.

## 4. How to Use These Documents
These documents can be utilized for various purposes throughout the project lifecycle:

*   **Understanding Existing Pages:** Quickly grasp the design and functionality of any given page without needing to deep-dive into the code.
*   **Planning New Features:** Use the existing page structures and functionalities as a reference when planning additions or modifications.
*   **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** Identify expected behaviors and dependencies when investigating issues.
*   **Onboarding New Developers:** Provide a quick and accessible reference for new team members to understand the project's frontend architecture.
*   **Communication:** Serve as a common reference point for discussions among designers, developers, and stakeholders.

## 5. Important Notes and Observations
During the generation of these documents, several inconsistencies in the project's frontend dependencies were observed across different HTML pages. These include:

*   **Multiple jQuery Imports:** Some pages import jQuery multiple times, and from different versions or sources (e.g., local files, various CDNs). This can lead to performance issues and potential JavaScript conflicts.
*   **Mixed FontAwesome Versions:** Different pages utilize different versions of FontAwesome (e.g., FontAwesome 4, FontAwesome 5, FontAwesome 6). This can result in inconsistent icon rendering and unnecessary resource loading.
*   **Mixed Bootstrap Versions:** The project uses both Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 across different pages. This is a significant framework version inconsistency that can cause layout and functionality discrepancies and makes maintenance more complex.

It is highly recommended to address these inconsistencies to improve overall site performance, maintainability, and consistency.
